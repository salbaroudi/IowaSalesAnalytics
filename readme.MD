### About this Project:

Here, I attempt to analyse Liquor sales for the state
of Iowa, and render some nice analytics summarizing the
data. 

### Tech Stack:

Dask, Pandas, Matplotlib, Altair, Tableau Public, scikit-learn, Vega.

Front End Visualizations: Vega+Jquery and/or
Tableau Public Embedded visualiaztions.

SimpleHTTPServer wil be used to render the pages.


### Analytic Context:

I will first explore the data, and then produce
relevent visualizations that a typical company might
ask, given this data set.
